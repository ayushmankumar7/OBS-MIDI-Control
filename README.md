# OBS-MIDI-Control

Hey! So i just started streaming and thought "Would it not be a great idea to have a tool which changes the screen for me?". I have seen such a device on Amazon. It costs F**** Rs 15000-25000. 
Why should I pay just for a bunch of buttons? So my Indian Jugaadu mind worked. <br/>
I had a mini MIDI Controller(Keyboard) - AKAI MPK MINI 3. I thought it has many buttons, keys and knobs and also a f**** joystick. What if I can access the MIDI messgaes and use to as a utility tool than just a Keyboard.<br/>
### There the HACKING began!

So my first MIDI enabled tool is a OBS Controller.
